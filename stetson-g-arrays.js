/*
Arrays [0]
*/

//Organizing and storing ordered information; is foundational to programming.


//Lists can organize real life data
/*
How to make it:
1. Make a bed
2. Doing things
3. You get it
*/

//Now it's time to write a list in Javascript as an array
let newYearsResolutions = ['Keep a journal', 'Take a falconry class', 'Learn Kubernetes'];
let howTo = ['Make a bed', 'Doing things', 'You get it'];

//Arrays are Javascript's way of making lists.
/*
Arrays can store any data types (including strings, numbers, and booleans)
Like lists, they are ordered
*/

//Creating an array
/*
One way is to use an array literal.
It creates am array by wrapping items in [square brackets]
Arrays can store any data type

Each element within an array is called an element.
Each element is seperated by comma
*/

//practice
const hobbies = ['Gaming', 'guitar', 'art'];
console.log(hobbies);



//Accessing Elements
/*
Every element has a numbered position called an index.
You can access indv. items by using theit index, its like referencing
 an item based on its position (or number) 
 Javascript arrays are zero-indexed. meaning they start counting from 0 instead of 1.
*/



//Practiuce
    listItem = [0];
    console.log(listItem);
    listItem = [2];
    listItem = [3];




//Updating Elements
/*
    We learned how to access elements inside an array from the last exercise
    Once we have acces to an element in an array, we can update its value 
*/
let seasons = ['Winter', 'Spring', 'Summer', 'Fall'];
seasons[3] = 'Autumn';
console.log(seasons);


//Practice
/*
    change each value in newYearsResolutions array without directly editing the array 
    at the top of the script to what I want to accopmplish
    Then console.log to check the modified array
